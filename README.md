🎨 Simple Colourful Calculator (Python Tkinter)
Hey there! This is a simple calculator I built using Python and Tkinter for the GUI part. It performs basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
I also added some cool colors to make it look fun and fixed button alignment so it’s neat and easy to use.

Number buttons (0-9)
Basic math operations (+, -, *, /)
Equal button to show result
