# ðŸŽ¨ Simple Colourful Calculator (Python Tkinter)
Hey there!
This is a simple calculator I built using **Python** and **Tkinter** for the GUI part. It performs basic arithmetic operations like **addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division**.  
I also added some cool colors to make it look fun and fixed button alignment so itâ€™s neat and easy to use.
## âœ¨ Features
- Number buttons (0-9)
- Basic math operations (+, -, *, /)
- Equal button to show result
- Clear button to reset the screen
- Colorful buttons with a dark theme background
- Clean and aligned button layout
